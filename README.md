## Insights:

- Emissions have been declining since 2015, and there was also a sharp decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 halting production (lockdown, etc)
- The decline since 2015 could show the UKâ€™s leaning stance towards renewable energy and less on fossil fuels as they are producing fewer emissions.
- Especially after 2021 there was a drop again could represent policy changes to adjust to the pandemic, as well as increased investment into renewable energy to meet the clean energy quotas
- Power stations are the biggest source - electricity, etc, primarily due to electricity generation from fossil fuels, accounting for **over 99% of emissions in their category**.

- Transport is the highest sector in terms of emissions in the UK and 9 times the average, making it a critical target for reduction policy.
- The bar chart of the fuel groups shows that the UK is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels/non-renewable energy ( gaseous fuels and petroleum)
- Additionally, CH4, methane, is the second biggest contributor to global warming!

## Limitations 

## Tech Stack 

- **Google BigQuery (Cloud Data Warehouse): stored dataset, cleaned and transformed data using SQL**
- **SQL: performed data cleaning and transformation queries.**
- **Google Looker Studio: built an interactive dashboard for insights.**
